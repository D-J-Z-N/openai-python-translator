Just before the Parisians decamp to the countryside for summer, the city’s gallery scene springs to life. This year, Paris Gallery Weekend falls on May 23rd through 25th and brings together 74 galleries across the capital for vernissages, performances, exhibition walkthroughs, and artist talks. Now in its second decade, the initiative was founded to spotlight the richness of Paris’s contemporary art landscape. Offering a counterpoint to the growing dominance of the art fair circuit, the weekend has become a fixture on the city’s cultural calendar.
